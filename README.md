# EMG-Processing
Collection and MATLAB processing of electromyography data 

# Description
This data was collected using a BioRadio and surface EMG electrodes on the biceps brachii. 5 contractions with rest in between were performed, each aiming to increase the magnitude of each subsequent contraction
  
This code takes inputs of both raw and analog filtered data. The raw data is processed and compared to the prefiltered data

The timing of each muscle contraction and the corresponding integrated contraction values are then calculated to estimate EMG values

# Getting Started
The code will run as it with the data provided, or the data collection can be completely redone using the methods described above
